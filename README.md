# cuSNN-samples
Samples for [**cuSNN**](https://github.com/fedepare/cuSNN#cusnn-samples) developers which demonstrate the main features 
provided by the library.

At the moment, all samples available are to the motion-selective hierarchical SNN proposed in 
["*Unsupervised Learning of a Hierarchical Spiking Neural Network for Optical Flow Estimation: From Events to Global 
Motion Perception*" (Paredes-Vall√©s, F., Scheper, K.Y., and de Croon, G.C.H.E., 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10936).
More varied samples will be included in the near future.
